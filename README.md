# Cluster-Analysis

Human genes are made up of DNA. Deoxyribonucleic acidis amolecule composed of two polynucleotide chains thatcoil aroundeach other to form a double helix carrying geneticinstructionsfor the development, functioning, growth and reproductionof allknown organisms and many viruses.

A nucleotide is an organic molecule that is usuallytermed asATCG [ adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), andthymine (T)].The triplet permutation, combination of these nucleotidesfromamino acids. Chain of amino acids leads to the formationofproteins. These proteins make up the important biologicalcomponent DNA. A point mutation iswhen a single basepair isaltered. For example in place of ATC if ATG is presentthat willbe a point mutation . Our blood cells have DNAs. Consideringacertain type of cancer is initiated by a virus. The virus wouldlead to point mutation. Some certain point mutationslead tothe formation of cancer cells.

Our project is to come up with an algorithm that clustersthepoint mutation to the formation of brain cancer cells.


K- means clustring and Mean Shifting CLustering have been implemented. The comparision between both the parameters have also been made using appropriate evaluation metrics.
